# Time Stamp

A font in one weight based on the font used by the employee clock-in machine at the screen-printing shop I worked at for the summer of 2014. With only the letters that form the abbreviations of the weekdays (M, TU, W, TH, FR), in addition to the numbers 0â€“9, an entire uppercase alphabet was drawn from scratch/memory.
